:class:`~xtr_dependency_injection.decorator.target.Target` picks a qualified
service; it lives in its own module.

``Injected[T]`` marks a parameter as container-provided — the default
autowiring, resolved by type. It is the alias
:data:`Annotated[T, Autowire()] <Injected>`. Users never import wireup's
markers; the compiler rewrites ours into wireup's before any signature is
presented to the engine.
