"""Synthesizing a lazy ``ServiceLocator[T]`` injectable per collectable service type.

wireup builds ``Sequence[T]`` and ``Mapping[Hashable, T]`` collections for every
registered service type, eagerly, keyed by each member's qualifier. This module
mirrors that for :class:`~xtr_dependency_injection.runtime.service_locator.ServiceLocator`:
for each type the container provides — and each ``ServiceLocator[T]`` a definition's
provider asks for — it registers a factory building a
:class:`~xtr_dependency_injection.runtime.service_locator.ServiceLocator` whose keys
are exactly those ``Mapping[Hashable, T]`` would receive, but whose entries resolve
only when asked for by name.

Why a locator per type rather than one generic factory: wireup keys a service by
its full parameterized type, so ``ServiceLocator[Mailer]`` and
``ServiceLocator[Logger]`` are two distinct registrations, each with its own entry
set. Building them here — off the final definitions, alias forwards included — keeps
the entry keys in lock-step with the qualifiers wireup registers.

A locator resolves in the scope its consumer was built in. A locator over
singleton-only members is a singleton and holds the root container; one over any
scoped or transient member follows that lifetime and holds the scope's container,
built where its scoped consumer is. So a scoped consumer's locator resolves scoped
entries from its own scope, a singleton's from the root — and a singleton consumer
that asks for a scoped-membered locator is refused at build with the same scope
error wireup gives, exactly as for ``Mapping[Hashable, T]``.
